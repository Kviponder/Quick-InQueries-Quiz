    The quiz interface should be centered on the page and have appropriate margins and padding.
    The interface should have a clean, modern design that is easy to read and navigate.
### Buttons
    The Start Quiz, Submit Answers, and View Results buttons should be styled with appropriate colors and borders.
    Hover and active states should be clearly indicated so users know when they are interacting with the buttons.
### Timer
    The timer should be prominently displayed and easily readable.
    When the timer reaches 10 seconds or less, it should turn red to indicate the end of the quiz is near.
### Question and Answer Options
    Each question should be clearly labeled and have appropriate spacing and margins.
    The answer options should be clearly labeled and styled to make it easy for users to select their answer.
    The correct answer should be clearly indicated after the user selects an answer.
### Game Over Screen
    After the quiz is over, the user should be presented with a screen that allows them to enter their initials and see their score.
